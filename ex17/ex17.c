/*
Stack vs. Heap

So for practical purposes, malloc == heap, else == stack.
This isn't a perfect representation, but it'll do for now.

If you need something to stick around for a long time, a big chunk of data,
etc., go heap.
Else, if you need something around only for a little bit and need it really fast,
go stack. 

Lots more details...
